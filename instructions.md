# Joint Assignment: Data Campaign! 
Today we focus on categorizing and mapping exercise of various existing repositories of data and e-science platforms.
you have time until next week Thursday to review! 
## Breakout into groups, 
* Each groups nominated a speaker and decides on an easy to spell and write acronym (name)
* Optional you can decide on a logo too, but only if you have time and in the break. 
* Go to https://github.com/materials-discovery/data-campaign-2122
* Open (on Github) the Readme file in raw (i.e., in source not html) 
* Copy the entire text, do not change the Readme file! 
* Go back and create a new file with the name 
* <Repository>_Acronym.md (replace <respository> with your teams designated repo/platform)
* Paste the contents (which you copied in step 6). 
* Now visit your designated repository or platform, and study it, fill the md file, 
* Donâ€™t forget to commit your changes with comments! 

Please note: we work out in the open (Public repository)! The repository is opensource, you are contributing to the common good, cheer up :-) any one can view our work!
